# Dos Mundos Specialty Café – Digital Sales Channel

Functional digital sales prototype designed for a Salvadoran specialty coffee café.

## Overview

This project consists of the design and implementation of a lightweight, independent digital sales channel for Dos Mundos Specialty Café.

The objective was to integrate the brand’s existing “Dos Mundos” concept into a structured, operational online store without relying on external e-commerce platforms.

## Context

Prior to development, the café had a strong physical presence and brand identity, but no dedicated online sales infrastructure.

A short discovery conversation with the owner helped clarify:

- The identity of the space  
- The conceptual meaning of “Dos Mundos”  
- Current commercial needs  
- The opportunity to enable direct online sales  

The goal was to create a system aligned with the brand’s narrative while adding a functional digital commerce layer.

## Concept Integration: “Dos Mundos”

Rather than simply dividing products, the dual-world concept became the structural backbone of the digital experience.

Two product universes were created:

- Mundo Cherito 🚚  
- Mundo Satoshi ₿  

This dual structure influenced:

- Navigation architecture  
- Catalog filtering logic  
- Visual identity  
- Calls to action  
- Conversion flow  

The conceptual identity was translated into an operational digital system.

## Online Store Implementation

A fully functional digital sales channel was developed with:

- World selector interface (`/shop.html`)  
- Filtered catalog views  
- Dynamic product filtering  
- Cart system with automatic calculations  
- Persistent cart logic (localStorage)  
- Automatic WhatsApp order generation  
- Modular JavaScript structure  
- Externalized product data (`products.json`)  

The system allows sales without dependency on third-party platforms.

## Technical Architecture

The project was built using a lightweight modular approach:

- HTML  
- Custom CSS  
- Vanilla JavaScript  
- JSON-based data structure  
- GitHub Pages deployment  
- No external dependencies  

The repository documents 138 commits, reflecting an iterative and progressive development process.

## Visual & UX Approach

The visual system maintained the brand’s clean, neutral aesthetic while enhancing usability:

- Modern sans-serif typography  
- Rounded UI elements  
- Clear separation between experience and commerce  
- Minimalist navigation  
- Mobile-responsive structure  

Images were optimized and adapted for web performance.

## Development Process

- Initial client conversation  
- Analysis of existing website  
- Architecture definition  
- Iterative development  
- Functional testing (desktop & mobile)  
- Refinement and optimization  

Approximate development time: 20 hours of focused work.

## Status

Functional prototype of an independent digital sales channel.

### Next Steps for Full Deployment

- Dedicated hosting and custom domain  
- Payment gateway integration (Stripe / BTC Lightning / etc.)  
- SEO optimization  
- Inventory management integration  
- Conversion tracking and analytics
